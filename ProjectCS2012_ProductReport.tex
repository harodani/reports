\subsection{Erlang}
The backend group decided with the client to have our product written in Erlang because of it's fault-tolerance, scaleability and ease of distribution. Erlang is also a product of research done by the client in the past. This means that we have access to many indivudals who are competent in the language at our disposal. 
\subsection{Javascript}

Javascript was used when the backend group decided to create a simple http interface to the Netinf Name Resolution server in order to show a proof of concept (NetInf streaming). Javascript was used to calculate the hash of files for streaming.
