Pre-SCRUM
In the first few weeks the entire Project CS team read up on ICN in general and NetInf in particular while trying to decide on what our project would be. We also had team-building exercises.

Sprint 1
We all set up our working environment and had two workshops, one on Erlang and one on agile development. I also read up on OTP, did some example programs, helped other team members get a hang of functional programming and worked a little on the simple demo server with Marcus.

Sprint 2
I worked on the message parsing and handling with Faroogh. I also worked on the first draft of the internal message specification and implementation with Kiril. At the end of the sprint I worked with Linus in the front end to make our systems work with each other.

Sprint 3
First I did some re factorization, after that I worked on the search both in the message handling and in the list database. I also worked on the presentation at Ericsson with Knut

Sprint 4
This sprint I fixed some minor bugs, added some statistics keeping in the server and worked on the backlog grooming

Sprint 5
I started working on UDP convergence layer with Kiril

Sprint 6
I started the sprint fixing a lot of minor things and while doing that I found a bug in one of our open source  dependencies and got that fixed

Sprint 7
In this sprint the entire group worked on report writing and the final presentation
