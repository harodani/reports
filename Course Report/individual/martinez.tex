In the first sprint, I worked defining the code convenctions that we wanted to use. 
We discussed them, refined them and I set up the Eclipse plug-in Chekstyle with the chosen convenctions.
Also, I was selected as spokesperson of the group for the whole project, so I managed the communication 
between the customer and the group.\\

In the following sprint, Kim-Anh, Paolo, Linus and I worked on the first architecture draft. On the other hand,
I worked with Linus on the developed of the earliest version of the Resolution Service that will connect with the 
backend's Name Resolution Service, implementing the get and publish methods.\\

In the third sprint, I prepared together with Knut and Thomas the presentation for Ericsson, I also presented this. 
Then I worked together with Kim-Anh designing the Information Object database that will be used for the 
Local Resolution Service.\\

In the fourth sprint, Linus and I cretaed the settings GUI for the Android application, letting the user to change 
some configurations values. I also set up a GitHub account to share the evolution of our project. In order to improve 
the user experience in the application I separate the Bluetooth discovery process and create a scheduled discovery that 
will be triggered from the moment the application starts and runs every five minutes.\\

In the fifth sprint, I began defining and implementing the Bluetooth Convergence Layer, however, due to time constraints 
and other priorities, this job was not finnished.
