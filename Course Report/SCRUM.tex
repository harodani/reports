\section{SCRUM}
The project generally specifies SCRUM project methodology. This is rapidly becoming the standard in companies who develop software and makes sense for students who are about to go into the real world of software development to learn it.

\subsection{Roles}

SCRUM distinguishes between SCRUM MASTER, Product Owner and the team. 

Scrum master position means an individual who will be responsible for the product in a particular sprint, as well as liaise between the team and the product owner.

Product Owner position means an individual who is considered to be the client in the project. The person who owns and controls the development of the software, adding and taking away features and generally the one who is supposed to give you the direction in sprint planning and demos.

The team is the set of individuals who are working on the code for the product owner.

\subsection{Daily meetings and Sprint planning}

Since we have two teams (ERNI and LISA) we had two distinct sets of meetings and sprints. This meant that we had to bear in mind what the other team was doing since we were supposed to work in sync. One scrum master for each team with constant communication between both teams.
