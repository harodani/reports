\section {Timeline}

The following is a timeline of both team's scrum sprints. Please note that we were generally in sync with each other until sprint 4 where ERNI elected to have a one week sprint and LISA elected to have a two week sprint. The result was a series of one week sprints for the ERNI team ending with seven sprints in total, while LISA had only five.

The course ran over a period of 4 and a half months starting in September until January 18th, with 2 major presentations. This particular instance of the course was a unique one since our group did not have a very concrete project laid out in terms of requirements. Therefore our real work and Scrum sprints started slightly later than other course instances. 

\subsection{Pre-Scrum}
During the month of September the group met with the client who presented the idea, although it was not very concrete at the time. The lack of tight requirements gave us the freedom to choose the direction of where the project was going to go, however many felt that it was a little too free resulting in many weeks of research and no real direction. 

In general the first few weeks of the course start with an Erlang workshop which consists of two weeks of intensive Erlang, however our project was so open that we had no idea on whether we would need Erlang at all.
