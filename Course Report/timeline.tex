\section {Timeline}

The following is a timeline of both team's scrum sprints. Please note that we were generally in sync with each other until sprint 4 where ERNI elected to have a one week sprint and LISA elected to have a two week sprint. The result was a series of one week sprints for the ERNI team ending with seven sprints in total, while LISA had only five.
