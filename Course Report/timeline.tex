\section {Timeline}

The following is a timeline of both team's scrum sprints. Please note that we were generally synchronized with each other until sprint 4 where ERNI chose to have two one week sprints instead of one two week sprint. The result was a series of one week sprints for the ERNI team ending with seven sprints in total, while LISA had only six.

The course ran over a period of four and a half months starting in September until January 18th, with two major presentations. This particular instance of the course was a unique one since our group did not have a very concrete project laid out in terms of requirements. Therefore our real work and Scrum sprints started slightly later than other course instances. Furthermore we were too few people in order to have two groups
with two completely different clients.

\subsection{Pre-Scrum}
During the month of September the group met with the client who presented the idea, although it was not very concrete at the time. The lack of tight requirements gave us the freedom to choose the direction of where the project was going to go, however many felt that it was a little too free resulting in many weeks of research and no real direction. 

In general the first few weeks of the course start with an Erlang workshop which consists of two weeks of intensive Erlang, however our project was so open that we had no idea on whether we would need Erlang at all.

We started our first sprint after approximately one month.

Sprint 1 started off with setting up our working environment.
This included reading up on and configuring the tools we chose to use during the project,
which are described in \sect{tools}.

We had a Skype meeting with Hugo Negrette and Miguel Sosa, who worked on a
similar project before. Since their Master Thesis was a fundamental starting point
for us, they helped us understanding critical parts of their code.

Finally, we implemented a simple application that could send a message to
the backend team's Name Resolution Service and receive an answer. As
we had more time than we expected, we started implementing parts of
the Bluetooth communication.

}

Now that we succeeded to communicate with the backend's NRS,
we needed to send messages according to the NetInf specifications.
Thus, we investigated the specifications and embedded those message regulations
into our code. 

We designed our first architecture draft based on OpenNetInf and implemented
the most important modules for sending/receiving messages to/from the NRS -
this time using OpenNetInf. We managed to share Information Objects between
Android phones using Bluetooth. 

At this stage, the application could request a content using a short hash.
The specified hash was sent to the NRS and received a list of locators, that own
the requested object, in return. The locators were Bluetooth MAC adresses.
The application was then starting a Bluetooth discovery in order to find out
whether one of these locators was within reach. If so, a Bluetooth communication
to that locator was established. The hash was sent to the connected device, which
replied with the file that was identified by the hash.

During this sprint we tried to fix a bug that prevented some pages to display correctly.
Unfortunately we could reproduce the bug during the previous demo, so the goal of this sprint was to mainly
solve this bug and make sure we had a working application. After several tests we spotted the problem that was causing
the corrupted pages. The problem resided in the way we managed the search function and the messages sent to and from NRS,
causing the loading of the wrong identifier of the seeked web page after a search. The backend could solve the problem easily and our application
started working as expected. During this iteration we also noticed some slow downs due to how we used the timeouts
in our network requests, so we fine tuned them to get a decent speed when browsing web pages.

Afterwards we discussed what to evaluate and how to evaluate our application. We implemented then logging of network
activities by storing each request with the relative type of transmission used (uplink, NRS cache, bluetooth or database).
In order to produce some statistics we also stored the amount of data is transferred for each request and the time that
it takes to transfer the data. To simplify the test we added a functionality to automate the loading of several web pages
in sequence, so that we could gather a considerable amount of data from many web pages during each run of the application.

At this point we had a working web browser that used NetInf services and could support four different type of transmission link.
The next and last step would be to run the automated tests and analyze the obtained results, so that hopefully we would have interesting material
to show in the final report.
