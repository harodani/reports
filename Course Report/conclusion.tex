\section{Conclusion}
At the end of this project we can proudly say that this project was a success for us. 
We achieved almost all the goals that we had set for ourselves at the beginning of the project 
and during each sprint. Our customer Ericsson Research was also happy with our performance and 
they offered thesis opportunities to a number of our team members to continue working on the 
application that we built. 

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{What went well:}}\\
Even though we were not 100\% efficient, Scrum helped us a lot 
during all stages of this project. The daily stand-up meeting kept everyone updated on the 
progress of the project. The sprint planning gave us the opportunity 
to participate in meaningful discussions regarding how to build different functionalities as part 
of our product. We gained a lot of feedback during the retrospectives that made it possible
to improve our product development. We are thankful to the teaching staff for arranging different workhops for us. 
The Agile, Erlang and Testing workshops, held by experienced professionals who have been part of the 
industry for many years, were very helpful. 

For those who are going to be working with Erlang in future instances of this course, Erlang 
OTP in action is a great resource and helped greatly in the beginning of the course. Traditionally 
the course has a 2 week Erlang workshop, we however had one week of self-study (Erlang OTP in action and 
the online resource learn you some erlang for great good\footnote{http://www.Learnyousomeerlangforgreatgood.com}) 
followed by two days of an Erlang workshop. We believe this was a much better way to handle things since we got to 
make all the mistakes before and ask valuable questions afterwards when the expert came. 

The weekly fika is also something we would like to recommend to future students to continue. It is a 
good way to keep a friendly environment in the team and to get to know each other.     

\item{\textbf{What did not went well:}}\\ 
Another thing that we learnt during the course of this project was that not everything is going to be 
the way we plan it to be. We had problems with estimating the duration of different tasks in almost all 
the sprints. At times we overestimated the time we assigned for the completion of a particular task and 
at times we underestimated it. 

Another problem that we had was to choose the right software tool for a particular purpose. At the 
beginning of this project we spent too much time on installing and reading about the tools that we never 
used later because of other better options that we did not know about in advance. To give an example, we installed Buildbot for continuous integration but found 
it difficult to learn and manage so we switched to Jenkins instead. So our advice to future students is to 
spend some time in investigating what is the best tool that is easy to use and can be learnt quickly.

\item{\textbf{What can be improved:}}\\
 At times during this project we built functionalities that we had to scrap later because they were not 
 within the scope of the project. It is important to have a discussion before starting to code anything 
 and have the consensus of the team on everything so that you do not end up building something that would 
 be thrown away later. Communication is very important and team members should not shy away from asking 
 questions or demanding clarifications on anything.  
 
The communication with customer is also an important part of any software project and we think that 
for future instances of this course the customer should be involved more in the project and should 
provide concrete requirements. In our case Ericsson Research was the official customer 
but at most times we had to act as a customer for ourselves and make decisions that otherwise the real 
customer has to make. 
\end{itemize}

Furthermore we have some further notes to future students that take the same course.
Always make sure that a working agreement exists (timing, working hours, fika rules and much more) and
is kept by all team members! It is important that you stick to what you have agreed on or else
conflicts might arise. 
Remember to commit to your team. The Project CS can be a very nice course in which you
get to know new friends but it also comes with a big responsibility.
It is a great opportunity for you to work in such a big group since
it resembles your work environment in the future.
