\section{Use of SCRUM in this project}
Since the the project start we tried to apply the gained knowledge we got from studying Scrum.
We arranged the room and the desks to facilitate direct communication among team mates,
and we set up a whiteboard for the post-its. We decided also that each team member should try to
be the Scrum Master at least once. Since we were two teams, we also always had two Scrum Masters,
one for each team.

\subsection{Daily meetings}
Due to the separation of the group into two teams, we had two distinct sets of meetings in the two offices.
Daily meetings for the frontend team took place everyday at 9:00 o'clock sharp and time boxed to 15 minutes,
while at 9:15 the standup meeting would start for the backend group.
During both meetings the other team's Scrum Master would attend the other team meeting, and vice versa.


We think that these meetings was of great value as they could incourage everyone to say something and
expose their problems during the project. Also it was a good way for planning short tasks and catching bad decisions
early. Last, the scrum master 

This meant that we had to bear in mind what the other team was doing since we were supposed to work in sync.
One scrum master for each team with constant communication between both teams.
