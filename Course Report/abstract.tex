Project CS is a full-time full semester course where students learn to work in a big project in cooperation with industry partners.

In the 2012 version of the course students collaborated with Ericsson Research to develop applications in the domain of Information Centric Networking.  One team of five developed an ICN-enabled web browser for Google\"As Android  platform, while another team of eight developed a backend ICN prototype using Erlang.

SCRUM was considered a big help in the development of the products.
The groups experienced difficulties with planning and time-estimation of tasks.
