This document describes how our team worked to develop a web browser and a supporting
Name Resolution Service (NRS) based on the NetInf protocol in collaboration with Ericsson Research. 
In this report we describe how our team divided the work, the software development methodology we followed, 
tools that we used for coding and documenting. Individual members from all the team members can be
found in the end of the course report. We hope that this report will be helpful to the next year's students.
