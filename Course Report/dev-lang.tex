\subsection{Development Languages}

The LISA team used Java along with the Android SDK. Their application was targeted at JellyBean Android OS version 1.4.1 (Version 16).

The ERNI team used Erlang, Javascript, and HTML 5  as their development languages. The main product was coded in Erlang. During the final sprints the client wanted to add video streaming. As a result of this ERNI also created an HTML client interface to our system using Javascript and HTML 5.
