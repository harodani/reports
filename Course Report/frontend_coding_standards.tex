\lstset{language=Java}

The purpose of this document is to define the coding standars for the implemented Android-based application. These standars are based
on the Android Code Style Guidelines for Contributors\footnote{\url{http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html}}.

\section{Java Language Rules}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Do not ignore exceptions: Always handle the exception, or throw a new one according to the level of abstraction, 
 or handle it gracefully, or throw a new \textit{RuntimeException} in case there is nothing possible to do. 
 It is acceptable to ignore it if there is a good reason to do it, but you should comment the reason in the code.
 \item Don't catch a generic exception e.g. \textit{Exception e}. Alternatives to do this are:
 \begin{itemize}
    \item Catch each exception with a separate catch block after a single try.
    \item Refactor the code in order to have muliple try blocks.
    \item Rethrow the exception and let it be handle in the next level.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Do not use finalizers. Let the garbage collector fo its job
  \item Always write full imports. 
  \section{Java Style Rules}
  \item Use Javadoc standards for commenting code. Always write the descriptions in third person. This rule can be skipped if the
  method is too trivial e.g. a \textit{getters} and \textit{setters}.
  \item Do not excede fourty lines of code for each method.
  \item Try to keep the scope of a variable as small as possible. Also, try to initialize it with a proper value. 
  \item Order the imports beginning with Android libraries, then third parties libraries and ending with \textit{java} and \textit{javax} classes.
  \item For identation use four spaces for blocks and eight spaces for line wraps i.e. when the line of code is too long and needs to be cutted.
  \item Limit the line length to eighty characters. 
  \item Use the standard Java Annotations e.g. \textit{@Deprecated, @Override, @SuppressWarnings}.
  \item Use acronyms as words e.g. write \textit{XmlHttpRequest} not \textit{XMLHTTPRequest}.
  \item Use TODO comments for temporary fixes and future work.
  \item Use the five levels of logging i.e. Error, warning, informative, debug and verbose.
  \item Use the standard brace style: 
  \begin{lstlisting}
      public void foo() {
	  if (...) {
	      doSomething();
	  }
      }
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item Use the following naming conventions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Non-public, non-static field names start with m.
    \item Static field names start with s.
    \item Other fields start with a lower case letter.
    \item Public static final fields (constants) are letters in upper case and spaces replaced by underscores.
    Example:
    \begin{lstlisting}
      public class MyClass {
	  public static final int SOME_CONSTANT = 42;
	  public int publicField;
	  private static MyClass sSingleton;
	  int mPackagePrivate;
	  private int mPrivate;
	  protected int mProtected;
      }
  \end{lstlisting}
  \end{itemize}

  
\end{itemize}
