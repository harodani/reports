\subsection{OpenNetInf}

OpenNetInf \cite{opennetinf} is an open source implementation of NetInf in Java developed at the University of Paderborn. OpenNetInf is still in the very early development phase and mainly aimed at research. The frontend group decided to use OpenNetInf as the starting point for their NetInf functionality, but still had to implement and extend it to provide the needed functionality. One reason for choosing OpenNetInf, rather than starting from scratch, was to not have to reinvent the wheel. It was also a chance to contribute to an existing project. Another reason was the closely related work done in a previous master thesis \cite{masterthesis} which used OpenNetInf.
