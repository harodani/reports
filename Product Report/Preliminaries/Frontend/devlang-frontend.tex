\subsection{Java-Android}

Elephant was developed for Android, an operating system targeted at mobile devices. This made it all but natural to use Java since this is the primary supported language for Android applications. The fact that both OpenNetInf and a closely related previous master thesis \cite{masterthesis} also used Java further solidified this decision. Java is an imperative object-orient programming language. Access to Android API libraries and other tools needed for development are provided by the Android SDK which can be integrated into the Eclipse IDE.
