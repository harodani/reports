\subsection{Erlang}
Erlang is a concurrent, functional, fault-tolerant language with great scalability and ease of distribution. It was developed by Ericsson in the mid 80's and became open source in 1998.\cite{otpInAction} These factors among others such as the customer being Ericsson Research made Erlang the language of choice for the NRS implementation.
Another reason for choosing Erlang is that it uses the idea of modules and nodes as a primary platform for serving a function. This allowed the product to be broken up into several parts, supporting concurrent development.
\subsection{Javascript}
Javascript \cite{javascript} was used when the backend development team decided to create a simple HTTP interface to the NRS in order to show a proof-of-concept (NetInf streaming). Javascript was used to calculate the hash of files for streaming as well as for asynchronous communication with the NRS.
