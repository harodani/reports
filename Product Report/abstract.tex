In Information Centric Networking (ICN), content is delivered to users based on what they request without taking into consideration
the physical location of the content. An application based on the NetInf protocol to store, share and retrieve data objects in a 
network was developed on the request of Ericsson Research. Contrary to the conventional host based information retrieval, the application 
retrieves information based on the name of the stored data. This is central to the concept of information centric networking and the Netâ€ŒInf 
protocol provides a good way to achieve this goal.

In Information Centric Networking (ICN), content is delivered to users based on the name of the requested resource without taking into consideration
its physical location. Based on the NetInf protocol, an Android application backed by an Erlang implementation of a Name Resolution
Service were implemented and are presented in this report. By comunicating with each other, both systems store, share and retrieve data objects in an ICN fashion,
fulfilling the requirements of Ericsson Research being the customer of the developed product. In situation with network congestion where the content is difficult or impossible
to retrieve, the system can use alternate transfer methods to facilitate the delivering of content.
