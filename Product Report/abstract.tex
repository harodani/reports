\begin{abstract}
In Information Centric Networking (ICN), content is delivered to users based on
the name of the requested resource without taking its physical location into consideration.
Based on the NetInf protocol, an Android application backed by an Erlang implementation of a
Name Resolution Service was implemented and both products are presented in this report.
By communicating with each other, the systems store, share and retrieve data objects in an ICN fashion.
In situations of network congestion content is difficult or impossible to retrieve.
Using ICN, the system can provide alternate transfer methods to facilitate the delivering of content.
