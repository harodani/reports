\section{Abstract}
In Information Centric Networking (ICN), content is delivered to users based on what they request without taking into consideration the physical location of the content. We developed an application based on the NetInf protocol to store, share and retrieve data objects in a network. Contrary to the conventional host based information retrievel, our application retrieves information based on the name of the stored data. This is central to the concept of information centric networking and the Netâ€ŒInf protocol provides a good way to achieve this goal.
