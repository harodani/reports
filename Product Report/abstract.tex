\begin{abstract}

In Information Centric Networking (ICN), content is delivered to users based on what they request without taking into consideration
the physical location of the content. An Erlang application based on the NetInf protocol to store, share and retrieve data objects in a 
network was developed on the request of Ericsson Research. Contrary to the conventional host based information retrieval, the application 
retrieves information based on the name of the stored data. This is central to the concept of information centric networking and the Netâ€ŒInf 
protocol provides a good way to achieve this goal.
