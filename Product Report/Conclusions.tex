\section{Conclusions}
The main goal of this project was to develop an application based on the principles of information centric networking using the NetInf protocol. This goal was achieved and the project team was able to build this application using Java and Erlang/OTP. It is a distributed, concurrent and fault tolerant application as per the principles of OTP. The project team had a clear goal in its sight when it started this project and achieved it comfortably in the end. Infact, the team added the functionality to support streaming videos using the application. This functionality was not part of the original plan but because the team achieved all the other major goals well before time, it had the time to add this functionality at the end. 

The client for this project Ericsson Research was also satisfied with the work done by the project team.
