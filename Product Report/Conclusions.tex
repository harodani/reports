\section{Conclusions}
The main goals of this project were to develop applications based on the principles of information centric networking using the NetInf protocol. These goals were achieved and the teams were able to build the applications using Java and Erlang/OTP. The backend product(NetInf NRS) is a concurrent and fault tolerant application as per the principles of OTP. Both teams had clear goals when they started the project and achieved it comfortably in the end. Infact, the backend team added functionality to support streaming videos using the application. This functionality was not part of the original plan but because the team achieved all the other major goals well before time.

The client for this project Ericsson Research was also satisfied with the work done by the project team.
