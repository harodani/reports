\subsection {Dependencies}

The system architecture for the backend relies on a few external libraries. The following are important for the system to run well. 

\begin {enumerate}
\item Erlang Cowboy - with it's own set of dependencies Ranch, and Crypto
\item Erlang RTS 
\item Erlang covertool
\item Erlang JSON library
\item Riak - with search hooks and a Key-Value(KV) bucket installed.
		(Only used for using the system with Riak database)
\end {enumerate}
